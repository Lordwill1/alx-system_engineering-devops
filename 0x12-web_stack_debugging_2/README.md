# Web stack debugging #2

This was the third in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these
projects, I was given broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers,
and tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state. For each
task, I wrote a script automating the commands necessary to fix the
web stack.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Run software as another user**
  * [0-iamsomeonelese](./0-iamsomeonelese): Bash script that runs the command
  `whoami` under the user passed as argument.
  * Usage: `./0-iamsomeonelese <user>`

* **1. Run Nginx as Nginx**
  * [1-run_nginx_as_nginx](./1-run_nginx_as_nginx): Bash script that fixes a
  web server to run Nginx listening on port `8080` as the `nginx` user.

* **2. 7 lines or less**
  * [100-fix_in_7_lines_or_less](./100-fix_in_7_lines_or_less): Bash script
  that fixes a web server to run Nginx listening on port `8080` as the `nginx`
  user.
  * 7 lines long.
